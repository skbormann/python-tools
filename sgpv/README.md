# sgpv package

This package allows to calculate Second Generation P-Values and their diagnostics in Python.
This package is a translation of the original  [sgpv R-library](https://github.com/weltybiostat/sgpv) into Python.
The same library has already been translated into [Stata](https://github.com/skbormann/stata-tools/sgpv) by me.
